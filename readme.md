  <em>Attention visualization comparison with open-source VLA baselines in the zero-shot setting.
  Before task-specific fine-tuning, Pelican-VLA 0.5 directs its action-pathway attention to the
  instruction-relevant object and contact area, while other open-source VLA models show more
  diffuse attention over the robot arm, surrounding objects, or background.</em>
</p>

## Overview

**Pelican-VLA 0.5** is a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that integrates
vision-language understanding, future-frame generation, and action prediction within a
single shared [Qwen3-VL 4B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen) backbone. It is built by the
**WFM System Group** at the Beijing Innovation Center of Humanoid Robotics (X-Humanoid).

A central goal of VLA research is generalization across objects, scenes, tasks, and
embodiments. Yet most VLA models attend *diffusely*, spreading attention across the robot
arm, background clutter, and task-irrelevant objects. Pelican-VLA 0.5 instead achieves
**attention-level generalization**: without object annotations, segmentation masks,
attention supervision, or task-specific fine-tuning, its action pathway already
concentrates on the instruction-relevant object and its contact region. This behavior
persists across unseen scenes and unseen robot embodiments.

The key design is a compact set of learnable **bottleneck tokens** inserted between
perception and action. Rather than letting the action pathway attend directly to dense
visual tokens, the bottleneck tokens form a fixed-capacity interface that routes manipulation-relevant
information into action generation. We verify that this manipulation-centric attention is
induced specifically by the bottleneck tokens, and that it transfers even to a MoT-style
architecture.

  <em>Overview of Pelican-VLA 0.5. A shared Qwen3-VL 4B backbone unifies visual-language
  understanding, future-frame prediction, and action generation. The input sequence contains
  four segments — vision-language <b>prefix</b>, temporal/world <b>middle</b> latents, 32
  learnable <b>bottleneck tokens</b>, and a <b>suffix</b> of state and noisy action tokens. A
  single forward pass predicts future-frame latents, a compact task representation, and action
  denoising velocities.</em>
</p>

After fine-tuning on RoboTwin, Pelican-VLA 0.5 reaches **91.4%** success on *RoboTwin Clean*
and **91.0%** on *RoboTwin Randomized*, the best average among open-source VLA baselines.

## News

* **[2026-07-08]** The Pelican-VLA 0.5 [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.06655)
  is released.
* **[2026-07-14]** Model weights, inference code, and visualization code are released.
* **[2026-08-28]** Training code will be open-sourced. The release has been moved from
  July 28 to August 28: the team is currently occupied with real-robot motion work and with
  the **World Robot Conference (WRC)**, where we are preparing a live Pelican-VLA 0.5 demo.
  Together with the training code, we will also release the data collected for that demo.

## TODO

* [x] **July 14, 2026:** release the model weights, inference code, and visualization code.
* [ ] **August 28, 2026:** open-source the training code (rescheduled from July 28 due to
  real-robot motion work and WRC preparation).
* [ ] **August 28, 2026:** release the data collected for the Pelican-VLA 0.5 WRC demo.

## Visualization and Reproducibility

We have released [visualization tools](attention_vis/README.md) that can load our pre-trained
model and run on your own collected data. These tools are intended to help users verify whether
the model's attention focuses on the task-relevant object, the gripper, and the actionable
manipulation region.

For step-by-step instructions on how to visualize attention, see
[`attention_vis/README.md`](attention_vis/README.md). It walks through installing the
visualizer, wiring up the [inference release](pelican_vla0.5_infer/README.md) and checkpoints,
dumping action-to-image attention, and rendering the figures.

Beyond the datasets we ship, the visualizer also runs on **your own collected data**, as long
as it is packaged as a [LeRobot 3.0](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) dataset. See
[*Visualize on your own collected data*](attention_vis/README.md#visualize-on-your-own-collected-data)
for how to register your recording and dump its attention.

We also commit that **RoboTwin data was not used during pre-training**. On August 28, 2026,
we will release the training code so the community can train the model and reproduce the
RoboTwin zero-shot evaluation. This date was pushed back from July 28 because the team is
currently focused on real-robot motion work and on preparing a Pelican-VLA 0.5 demo for the
World Robot Conference (WRC); the data collected for that demo will be released alongside
the training code.

initialization) and the frozen **NVIDIA Cosmos-Tokenizer** (visual history / future-frame
branch) are also required.

```bash
# Download the pre-trained model

```

## Performance on RoboTwin

On the RoboTwin 2.0 benchmark, Pelican-VLA 0.5 achieves the best average success rate among
open-source VLA baselines in both the clean and randomized settings. The gap between the two
settings is only 0.4 points, indicating that the policy does not rely on the nominal
appearance of the scene.

## Zero-shot in RoboTwin

Without any task-specific fine-tuning, the pre-trained Pelican-VLA 0.5 is deployed directly
on held-out RoboTwin 2.0 tasks under unseen objects, unseen scene layouts, and a new robot
embodiment. The policy reaches toward the correct instruction-relevant object and produces
coherent, goal-directed motions — an early glimmer of generalization that emerges from the
manipulation-centric attention formed during pre-training.

## Limitations

Pelican-VLA 0.5 is an intermediate stage toward practical zero-shot manipulation. The
remaining **attention-to-action gap** is attributed mainly to data scale and action
representation: the current checkpoint is trained on only ~2,400 hours of heterogeneous
manipulation data and uses joint-position actions, which are more embodiment-specific than
end-effector pose representations.

Our next step is to scale both data and action experience. We plan to release a stronger
version trained on approximately **7,000 hours** of manipulation data, superseding the current
2,400-hour checkpoint, along with improved action parameterization and stricter data curation.
